.. py:currentmodule:: copulae.elliptical

The implementation of the Student (T) copula is such that all the univariate marginal distributions are student and the multivariate joint distribution is a multivariate-student distribution.

Note that the degrees-of-freedom parameter is shared by all univariate margins as well as the joint multivariate distribution
